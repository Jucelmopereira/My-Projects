Welcome to My GitHub!
Hello! I'm a beginner programmer currently focused on learning and improving my skills in C. I have a strong interest in cybersecurity, systems, and kernel development, and I'm on a journey to dive deeper into these fields in the future.

I'm always open to suggestions for improvement and advice to enhance my projects. My goal is to become a professional in these areas and contribute to projects that have an impact in the fields of cybersecurity and operating systems.

As I progress, I also plan to study other programming languages that suit my interests in cybersecurity and systems development. If you have any suggestions for languages or tools that are interesting for this path, I'd love to hear them!

Thank you for visiting my profile!
